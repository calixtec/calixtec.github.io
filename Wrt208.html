        </h1>
        <p>
            America is the third biggest country in the world and currently has the largest gdp. As a result it may seem 
            infeasible to implement a public transportation network that works very well and on a large scale. However, 
            many of the small countries that implement these strategies and have the most success are much smaller on average. 
            A list of some countries and their land masses include: Seoul Korea, 233.7 mi²;  In comparison America has an area of  
            3.797 million mi²For this reason the myth that we have is that America is simply too large. By extension it is 
            not possible for us to create a world where

        <h1 class="left-header">Myth 2: It is too expensive</h1>

        <p>
            In  recent years the cost of living for the Average American has skyrocketed. The price of homes, food, gas etc… has 
            risen without a significant increase in wages for workers. The result is that people can be on-guard about the things 
            that there tax dollars will be funding every year. However, I believe that it is important to challenge this idea when 
            it comes to public transportation specifically. Unfortunately, if any person is looking for public transportation to 
            pay for itself through its fares that would not be a possibility at the moment with our current tools. The good news is 
            that the benefits of public transportation have many benefits that outweigh the cost that must be considered. 
            For example, without the car there will be less of a need for insurance, fuel, or maintenance cost which come out of pocket.
